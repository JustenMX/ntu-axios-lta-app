### Axios

Research and consume public APIs listed at [GovData](https://data.gov.sg/).

### Description

- Study the API collection.
- Draft a simple UI layout and component diagramming (you don't have to submit this).
- Attempt consuming the API with React and Axios.
- Set up a simple GET request, query the API for data and display it on a React app

### Additional Implementations

- manipulate the lats data passed by the API
- convert the timestamp string passed to readable
- CRUD applications in Watch List component
- Fix component re-rendering and empty div appearing on page (bug)
- Validation of UX behaviors

### Currently Working on

- toast alert prompts and replace the current alert prompt implementations
- further UI/UX validations
- When add to WatchList, watchList to call back the API and display the filtered live updates based on the watchlist state updates
- Traffic Updates to display the exact location in street name - as of now its a link to google map using lats passed in the URL
